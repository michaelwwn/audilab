# AudiLab

AudiLab is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows music creators to upload their soundtracks to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and store them on the Ethereum blockchain through a smart contract. This project leverages the power of blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform for music distribution.
